## About Me

Hi everyone! I am Ruijue Song. I majored in Urban Management in Central University of Finance and economy in China from 2019 to 2023.

I am deeply interested in spatial data science, with a specific focus on using computational tools (like R and GEE) to automate complex urban analyses. So I hope CASA0023 will equip me with the technical skills to process and interpret satellite imagery, enabling me to move beyond traditional GIS mapping toward more advanced, data-driven environmental monitoring.
