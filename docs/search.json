    "text": "3.1.1 Ratio: NDVI\nRatioing exploits the contrast between spectral bands to highlight landscape features. A classic application is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). This index uses the fact that healthy vegetation reflects Near-Infrared (NIR) light strongly while absorbing most Red light for photosynthesis. We could use the NDVI index to highlight areas with healthy vegetation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Source: Agricolus\n\nAs shown in picture, I plotted the NDVI distribution of City of Cape Town using Landsat imagery from July 2022 in practical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Normalised Difference Vegetation Index for City of Cape Town\n\nWe could get more clear results by pulling out certain areas where NDVI is greater than 0.2. It is important to note that July is winter in Cape Town, which is the rainy season. The bright yellow and green areas in the north are mostly farmlands. Crops like wheat grow rapidly during this time, resulting in high NDVI values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  NDVI for City of Cape Town (only showing values above 0.2)\n\nIn contrast, the southern areas (like the Cape Peninsula) show lower values. This is because the native “fynbos” vegetation consists of woody shrubs with small leaves, which naturally reflect less light than leafy crops. Also, the steep mountains cast long shadows in winter, which can lower the NDVI readings.\n\n\n3.1.2 Texture\nTexture measures the spatial relationship and structural complexity between a pixel and its neighbors. It quantifies “smoothness” (high similarity between neighbors) versus “roughness” (high contrast).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Texture for City of Cape Town\n\nIn the Cape Town map, the colors are mixed together rather than separated into big blocks. The yellow pixels represent small, smooth spots, such as the middle of a field, where the color doesn’t change much. The blue and green pixels represent rough areas, which are usually the edges where one object ends and another begins. This speckled look shows that the whole image is full of small details and frequent changes, rather than large, empty spaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn my map, the speckled mix of yellow and blue suggests the texture is very fragmented. This is likely due to the small 3x3 window size used in the analysis.\nA small 3x3 window focuses on immediate neighbors, which makes it very sensitive to fine details and edges. The benefit is that it captures precise boundaries between objects. However, a limitation is that it picks up too much “noise”, resulting in a salt-and-pepper look. This makes it harder to identify broad, continuous zones (like a whole farm) compared to what a larger window (e.g., 7x7 or 15x15) might show.",

    "text": "1.2 Application\nIn this week, I mainly focus on literatures concerning applications of Sentinel-2 spectral signature on vegetation monitoring. In this area, there is a notable shift in literature from relying on traditional broad-band indices to exploiting specific narrow-band spectral signatures.\nStandard broad-band indices (such as the normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) often saturate at high leaf area index (LAI), which is a methodological limitation that newer studies solve by using red-edge bands. Sun et al. (2020) demonstrated that vegetation indices derived specifically from Sentinel-2’s narrow red-edge bands (RE2 and RE3) yield significantly higher accuracy for LAI estimation than traditional broad-band approaches. This finding is critical as it demonstrates the theoretical framework of spectral resolution. It suggests that for detailed vegetation monitoring, having more specific spectral bands is usually more useful than simply having higher spatial resolution. The clues about plant health are hidden in these narrow bands, and we will miss them if we only focus on spatial resolution.\nConsequently, the selection of sensors in modern studies has become a strategic evaluation, not just about spatial details, but also about evaluating spectral capabilities. While older sensors like Landsat-8 are better suited for providing historical data, comparative analyses show that Sentinel-2 has distinct advantages for agriculture study and vegetation monitoring for its specific spectral configuration. Addabbo et al. (2016) argue that a series of indexes for vegetation analysis can be obtained by using Sentinel-2 near infrared spectral band images, which was previously impossible by simply using Landsat-8 data. Reflecting on the trade-off, while Landsat-8 is essential for long-term trend analysis due to its extensive archive, modern vegetation monitoring needs the higher spectral sensitivity that only newer sensors could provide.\nThese literatures reinforce the lecture’s conclusion: the best sensor is not absolute but is dictated by the primary target of the research.",

    "text": "1.3 Reflection\nReflecting on the spectral feature space, I realized that remote sensing is more than just locating features, it is about understanding the biophysical composition, which is essential for making urban policy.\nFor example, using red-edge bands allows us to prove if a park is biologically healthy, rather than just checking if it looks green on a map. However, the problem I noticed that losing spatial detail when we prioritize spectral bands is a real challenge for complex cities. If we rely on Sentinel-2’s 20m pixels to study narrow streets, we might get mixed signals (like mixing a tree with a road), which could lead to wrong decisions in policies like managing urban heat islands. This trade-off makes me realize that for complex cities, just using SNAP (GUI) might not be enough. We have to explore using coding (like R or GEE) to handle these data challenges more flexibly or perhaps combine Sentinel-2 with higher-resolution images to get the best of both worlds.\n\n\n\n\nAddabbo, Pia, Mariano Focareta, Salvo Marcuccio, Claudio Votto, and Silvia Liberata Ullo. 2016. “Contribution of Sentinel-2 Data for Applications in Vegetation Monitoring.” ACTA IMEKO 5 (2): 44. https://doi.org/10.21014/acta_imeko.v5i2.352.\n\n\nSun, Yuanheng, Qiming Qin, Huazhong Ren, Tianyuan Zhang, and Shanshan Chen. 2020. “Red-Edge Band Vegetation Indices for Leaf Area Index Estimation from Sentinel-2/MSI Imagery.” IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing 58 (2): 826–40. https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2019.2940826.",

Additionally, a key application in disaster management is the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), which contrasts Near-Infrared (NIR) and Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) bands to identify burnt areas. High NBR values reflect healthy vegetation, while low values point to bare ground or recent burns. This website introduces how NBR can be used to identify burn severity by comparing the difference between the pre-fire and post-fire NBR (dNBR or ∆NBR).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Comparison of the spectral response of healthy vegetation and burned areas.

Relying solely on spectral data is insufficient for complex heterogeneous environments, such as distinguishing between formal and informal urban settlements (slums and shantytowns). Studies by Wang, Kuffer, and Pfeffer (2019) have successfully employed texture measures (GLCM) to distinguish slums from formal areas. They note that slums typically exhibit different structural patterns compared to planned housing. However, they point out a major challenge: the accuracy of the results depends heavily on the window size used. This mirrors the limitations I observed in my own practical results, where an arbitrary window size might lead to noise.",

It felt like I was finally drawing out the hidden stories in the data rather than just fixing errors. The biggest realization for me was that spectral data (ratio) isn’t the whole truth. Texture analysis fascinated me because it visualized the “roughness” of the city, picking up details that NDVI missed.\nHowever, the practical side made me realize how much my final map depended on a simple, subjective choice: the window size. It makes me slightly nervous to think about this in a real policy context: if we pick the wrong window size, we could completely misclassify a vulnerable settlement. In the future, I hope to explore more about data fusion (combining NDVI and texture), hoping that combining methods might reduce this reliance on manual trial and error.\n\n\n\n\nWang, Jiong, Monika Kuffer, and Karin Pfeffer. 2019. “The Role of Spatial Heterogeneity in Detecting Urban Slums.” Computers, Environment and Urban Systems 73 (January): 95–107. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2018.08.007.",

    "text": "4.2 Application\nTo decode these invisible environmental factors, EO data becomes indispensable. Singapore has moved beyond standard meteorological monitoring to deploying advanced active remote sensing. Specifically, the URA is trialing Wind LiDAR technology to capture vertical wind information, which serves to improve the robustness of wind flow simulations.\nCrucially, this sensor data feeds into sophisticated simulation platforms like the Integrated Environmental Modeller (IEM) and the Digital Urban Climate Twin (DUCT). By combining these environmental inputs with high-resolution 3D city models, planners simulate environmental factors to optimize the placement of green spaces for comfort and sustainability. This is a perfect example of the shift from reactive monitoring to preventative design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Integrated Environmental Modeller (IEM). Source: HDB\n\nWhile URA tools excel at district-level testing, optimizing green space in such a dense city requires a precise, algorithmic approach. Jia et al. (2024)’s case study on Singapore’s green space offers a critical solution. They utilized integrated spatial modeling algorithms (GWR coupled with DNN) applied to multi-source remote sensing inputs (Landsat LST and high-resolution structural data). This method allows planners to quantify the relationship between urban morphology and cooling intensity. Thus, they can use these algorithms to identify key cooling drivers and optimize configurations. For example, the findings suggest that in high-density areas like the CBD, connecting fragmented green patches to improve connectivity and wind flow may be more effective than isolated plantings.\nHowever, algorithms alone cannot address the ethical dimension of planning. Eugenio Pappalardo, Zanetti, and Todeschi (2023) used a climate justice framework in Italy to demonstrate that heat risk is rarely random. Instead, it spatially coincides with vulnerable demographics like the elderly and low-income households. While Singapore lacks historical redlining, significant thermal inequality exists between premium air-conditioned apartments and older, naturally ventilated public housing. Therefore, the proposed optimization model must incorporate social vulnerability layers to prioritize greening in these high-risk neighborhoods, ensuring thermal comfort is distributed equitably.",

Reacting to environmental issues only after they become crises is not enough. Singapore challenges this by using IEM and DUCT to predict micro climates before construction begins. This shift from reactive monitoring to proactive prevention is a crucial lesson: EO data should be a design tool, not just a reporting tool.\nHowever, the discussion on climate justice really resonated with me. It highlighted a potential blind spot in technical optimization. We can use complex algorithms to find the perfect spot for a tree to lower the temperature by \\(1^\\circ C\\), but if that spot is in a wealthy area that already has air-conditioning, is it truly “optimal”? I think social vulnerability should be treated as a variable just as important as other physical factors. True urban resilience is not just about building a cooler city, but building a fairer one.\n\n\n\n\nEugenio Pappalardo, Salvatore, Carlo Zanetti, and Valeria Todeschi. 2023. “Mapping Urban Heat Islands and Heat-Related Risk During Heat Waves from a Climate Justice Perspective: A Case Study in the Municipality of Padua (Italy) for Inclusive Adaptation Policies.” Landscape and Urban Planning 238 (October): 104831. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2023.104831.\n\n\nJia, Siqi, Yuhong Wang, Tan Chun Liang, Qihao Weng, Cheolhee Yoo, Wu Chen, and Xiaoli Ding. 2024. “Multiscale Estimation of the Cooling Effect of Urban Greenspace in Subtropical and Tropical Cities.” Urban Forestry & Urban Greening 98 (August): 128390. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2024.128390.",

    "text": "5.1.1 The Set Up of GEE\n\n5.1.1.1 Client side vs. Server side\nOne of GEE’s biggest advantages lies in its massive server side computational power and cloud-hosted data catalog, which allow users to perform planetary-scale geospatial analysis within seconds without downloading any data. However, the strict separation between the client side environment and server side objects also introduces a steep learning curve, such as the necessity of using .map() instead of traditional for loops for image collections.\n\n\n5.1.1.2 Scale\nUnlike traditional GIS software, GEE’s resolution is dynamically determined by the output rather than the input. During analysis, GEE aggregates images to fit a 256x256 grid. It selects the image pyramid level closest to the specified scale and resamples the data, utilizing nearest neighbor by default. This output-driven mechanism ensures fast processing and visualization for planetary-scale datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn interesting observation from the scale example is that querying a pixel at a 10m scale yields the exact same value as the 30m scale. This occurs because GEE cannot exceed the sensor’s native resolution (e.g. 30m for Landsat 8). Instead, it simply duplicates the base pixel using default nearest neighbor resampling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Functions\n\n5.1.2.1 Filter\nImages (raster data) could be filtered by date/location (specified path and row)/boundary/polygon. Features (geometries with attributes) can also be filtered by specific attributes.\n// filter by attributes (Delhi in India)\nvar Delhi = ee.FeatureCollection('users/path/india')\n  .filter('GID_1 == \"IND.25_1\"');",
